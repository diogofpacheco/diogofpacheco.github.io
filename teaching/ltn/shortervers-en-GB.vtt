00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.954
Welcome to the introduction of
the LTN simulator. My name is

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-1
00:00:03.954 --> 00:00:07.557
Poppy and my name is Denik and
we will guide you through this

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-2
00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:10.985
video. LTNS, or low traffic
neighbourhoods are residential

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-3
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:14.239
neighbourhoods which use
barriers to philtre and reduce

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-4
00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.725
traffic, creating a safer, less
busy space for cyclists and

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-5
00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.863
pedestrians to explore LTNS,
they created a programme

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-6
00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:24.059
simulation of Exeter's own
Heavitree, which is an area

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-7
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.545
currently undergoing an LTN
trial conversion. The simulated

a6b06a9c-d83a-4b1d-9aa8-4cebf4225030-8
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.090
environment achieves the barrier
effect through the means of

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-0
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.265
various philtres which can be
placed along the road at

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-1
00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:37.878
intervals of the user's choice.
For example, the user may place

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-2
00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:41.322
a blocker that prevents all
traffic from passing through, or

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-3
00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:44.878
one which only allows cyclists
to pass through. Our intent was

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-4
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.435
to provide a model that would
allow evaluation of the criteria

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-5
00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:51.766
such as mean and aggregated
travel time or noise pollution

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-6
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.927
for each of the possible
configurations. This minimises

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-7
00:00:54.927 --> 00:00:58.428
time spent trialling the LDN in
the real world, preventing as

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-8
00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:01.589
much disruption as possible.
This video will explain in

567d65f8-f789-4d16-89f4-49cfcb4ce054-9
00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.380
greater depths

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-0
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.959
the aims of our project, how it
functions and we'll play for you

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-1
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.850
three simulations. Where to put
the blockers within a

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-2
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.688
neighbourhood is not readily
apparent. Each possible

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-3
00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:14.847
configuration of blockers needs
to be evaluated for how it

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-4
00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:18.220
affects each of the criteria,
and these tests take a long time

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-5
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.485
when executed in the real world,
causing discomfort to local

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-6
00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.483
inhabitants. The team has
proposed using a simulator to

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-7
00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:27.910
address this issue. Evaluating
the configuration in a simulator

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-8
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.229
first allows for the discovery
of promising solutions, whilst

8491694d-e3e5-4894-ac97-39b2f57415c8-9
00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050
discarding those which was
caused

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-0
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.176
angio hardships. The simulation
has a neighbour represented as a

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-1
00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:40.663
graph through which the
travellers move. Each traveller

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-2
00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.901
has their daily agenda and is
physically present in

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-3
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:47.076
dissimulation. The travellers
have a maximum speed

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-4
00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:50.749
acceleration and cannot pass
through each other. They also

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-5
00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.796
maintain safe separation, enough
to stop before colliding if the

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-6
00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:58.158
other vehicle immediately
stopped and let pedestrians

d176869f-70a1-4bfa-90e3-68e1b3776290-7
00:01:58.158 --> 00:01:58.470
pass.

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-0
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.130
The programme also allows for
barriers to be placed throughout

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-1
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.351
the neighbourhood. There are
various types of barriers

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-2
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:10.041
available in the menu. They can
be placed manually to simulate

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-3
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.790
any sort of traffic restriction.
Here we show 3 simulations. In

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-4
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.362
the first simulation we show the
basic neighbourhood with no

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-5
00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:20.994
barriers placed. It serves as a
baseline to compare any other

c3585f7b-c06c-4db7-9211-2c14d8dbb9b0-6
00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:22.810
barrier configurations against.

e6cf2f56-4677-455b-95d8-b6128e572fe7-0
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.375
The second simulation has
barriers placed in excess and as

e6cf2f56-4677-455b-95d8-b6128e572fe7-1
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.990
we can see, they disrupt an
effective flow of traffic. This

e6cf2f56-4677-455b-95d8-b6128e572fe7-2
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.220
leads to an increase in travel
time.

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-0
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.255
The third simulation has
barriers placed the block heavy

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-1
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.594
traffic. This significantly
reduces noise pollution in the

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-2
00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:44.330
neighbourhood as well as directs
the flow of traffic. The optimal

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-3
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.782
placement of barriers within LDN
is a complex problem due to

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-4
00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:51.404
multiple competing objectives.
There may be configurations that

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-5
00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.687
are better in all objectives
than some other, but in most

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-6
00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:58.195
cases this will be a tradeoff
between the different competing

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-7
00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.817
objectives. It is also important
to look for good solutions and

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-8
00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:04.987
to test them before committing
to them, because the bad

fe9190cb-6eb6-4033-b70a-de15bdae7b1b-9
00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:05.440
solution

6a0e9857-f2af-4840-960c-b8202995d348-0
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.120
may be worse than no solution at
all.

53311279-0f49-4d53-809c-9be6ac324dc9-0
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.158
Now it's your turn. The
simulator is available from our

53311279-0f49-4d53-809c-9be6ac324dc9-1
00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:15.437
website. Give it a try yourself
and find a good barrier

53311279-0f49-4d53-809c-9be6ac324dc9-2
00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:18.540
configuration for Heavitree.
Thank you for watching.
